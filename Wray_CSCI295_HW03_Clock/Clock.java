HW 03 - Clock Class

Part I

*Create a class called Clock that represents a simple military style clock in which 
* hours range from 0 to 23. This class should store the time using three integers:
* one each for hours, minutes and seconds. The Clock class should have the following 
* public interface:
* 
* Constructors
*
*There should be four constructors:
*
*A default constructor that sets the time to midnight, which is 0:0:0.
*A constructor that takes one parameter which specifies the hour h. The time should be set to h:0:0.
*A constructor that takes two parameters, specifying the hour h and the minute m. The time should be set to h:m:0.
*A constructor that takes three parameters, specifying the hour h, the minute m, and the second s. The time should be set to h:m:s.
*If an invalid value is provided to any of the constructors, a value of zero should be used instead..
 */

public class Clock {
    
    
    
}

/* Accessors

*There should be a get method for the hour, minute, and second. 
*These should be called getHour, getMinute, and getSecond.
